Rock Paper Scissors

Hey it's Thomas !

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, built as part of my learning journey with The Odin Project. The goal was to practice basic JavaScript logic, conditionals, and user interaction.

Although the game works as expected, I am not fully satisfied with the structure and readability of the code. For that reason, I decided to restart the exercise in a separate repository to improve my approach, apply better practices, and write cleaner code.
